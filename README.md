# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed for academic, self learning, and professional purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

If you get the "Sorry, something went wrong" error, open [Jupyter NB Viewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) and paste the Github link. This will allow you to view the notebook when Github's backend fails.
